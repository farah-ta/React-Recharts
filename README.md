# React-Recharts
Recharts provides a huge variety of charts to implement in React projects. Install Recharts in your React project first through 
**npm install recharts**.
I have worked in simple chart and composed chart but you can pick the one that you like. The user documentation is vast and easy to understand. I have made them responsive by using the Responsive Container property.
