# Getting Started with ReCharts in React App

Recharts provide a vast variety of charts to include in your React projects. I have worked in Line Chart and Composed Chart but you can choose the one you need.  

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm install recharts`

This will install all Recharts in your react app and then import the necessary elemnts for charts. 

### `Responsive Container`

I have used the option of Responsive Container so they will work fine over all devices.
